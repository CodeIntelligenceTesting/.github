## Hello, World! :wave:
Welcome to Code Intelligence's organization on GitHub where we share our open-source projects and tutorials.

## :rocket: Projects
- [CI Fuzz CLI](https://github.com/CodeIntelligenceTesting/cifuzz): CLI tool that fuzz tests as easy as unit tests. It helps you integrate and run fuzz tests into your project.
- [Jazzer](https://github.com/CodeIntelligenceTesting/jazzer): our fuzzing engine for the JVM platform. It helps you to integrate fuzz testing to your Java, Kotlin, and other JVM-based languages.
- [Jazzer.js](https://github.com/CodeIntelligenceTesting/jazzer.js): our fuzzing engine for Node.js. It helps you to integrate fuzz testing into your JavaScript, TypeScript, and any language that can be transpiled into JavaScript.

## :dart: Examples
- [API Testing](https://github.com/CodeIntelligenceTesting/spring-boot-example): A Spring Boot example showing how you can perform API testing using CI Fuzz JUnit integration.
- [C/C++ Fuzz Testing](https://github.com/CodeIntelligenceTesting/c-cpp-demo): An example showing how CI Fuzz can help you integrate fuzz testing into your CMake project.
